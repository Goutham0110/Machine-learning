# House_price_prediction_using_multivariable_linear_regression
In this program we built a multivariable linear regression model and trained it to predict the price of a house. This model uses 5 variables to predict a single value. Since this is not a showcase but an implementation of multivariable linear regression to predict the price of a house with the attributes area, bedroom, bathroom, stories and parking. Using of test_train_split can reduce the accuracy of the mode so we decided not to use it. This program will take the attributes as input and predict the price of the house.
